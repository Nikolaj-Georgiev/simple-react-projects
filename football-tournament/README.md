## Project Architecture

The project is structured as follows:

- **App**: The main component that manages the routing of the application.
- **Home**: The component that visualizes the tournament stages and all matches. Click on any match lead to Match Details page.
- **MatchDetails**: The component for match details, displaying formations and results.
- **TeamDetails**: The component for team details, including a roster of all players.
- **Bracket**: A component displaying bracket view of the final four stages of the tournament

## Implementation Algorithm

### Loading CSV Files

CSV files are loaded using JavaScript's `fetch` function and are manually parsed into appropriate objects.

### Match Sorting

Matches are sorted by date. The tournament bracket is organized by stages (round of 16, quarter final, etc.).

### Visualization

React is used to create components that visualize different aspects of the tournament. The structure is designed to be responsive and easy to use.
